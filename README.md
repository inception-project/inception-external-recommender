This repository provides **[ariadne](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Ariadne)**, a library 
to run and implement external recommenders for INCEpTION using Python.

You can watch external recommender in action in the follwing video:

## Install required packages
For installing the required packages we provide a `setup.py` to simplify the process. To install
the basic requirements just run 
    
    pip install -e .

There are further requirements which need to be fulfilled depending on the use case. They are
listed and explained below:

* `contrib` for being able to use the provided already usable external recommenders (for a
 detailed overview see [Contrib Models](#contrib-models) below)
* `test` for being able to use the tests
<!--- * `doc` for being able to build the documentation % -->
* `dev` for being able to develop this package

Note that depending on your system, it may be necessary to install certain system libraries manually
before activating the contrib dependencies. For example on macOS, `libomp` is required by the `lightgbm`
contrib dependency:

    brew install libomp

To install for example the `contrib` dependencies run:
    
    pip install -e ".[contrib]"

 
## Starting a simple recommender

We provide multiple ready to use recommenders. A full overview of them can be found at [Contrib
 Models](#contrib-models).
 
In this section we provide an example on how to start a server with two recommenders, one for
named entities and one for parts-of-speech. They both use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and are
not trainable. 

Be aware that the english spacy model needs to be downloaded previously. This can be done by
running:
    
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm 

Then you can use this example code to start the server:

    from ariadne.contrib.spacy import SpacyNerClassifier, SpacyPosClassifier
    from ariadne.server import Server
      
    server = Server()
    server.add_classifier("spacy_ner", SpacyNerClassifier("en_core_web_sm"))
    server.add_classifier("spacy_pos", SpacyPosClassifier("en_core_web_sm"))

    server.start()
    
The external recommenders are afterwards reachable under `http://localhost:5000/spacy_ner` and 
`http://localhost:5000/spacy_pos` respectively.

To add them to your INCEpTION-project open its settings page and choose the tab *Recommenders*. 
Click on *Create* to create a new recommender. Then choose its properties according to the
picture below to add the part-of-speech recommender. Its name is generated automatically.

</p>

Click *Save* and open a text for annotation. After performing an action, e.g. making an
annotation, the recommendations are shown above the tokens. Adding the named-entity recommender
works similarly. A detailed description for using a recommender can be found in the 
[INCEpTION user guide](https://inception-project.github.io/releases/21.1/docs/user-guide.html). 
    
## Building your own recommender

See `ariadne/contrib/sklearn.py` for examples.

## Deployment

In order to support multiple users at once, the recommender server needs to be started on
a wsgi server. This can e.g. be done via [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/). We provide an
example in `wsgi.py` which can be run on `gunicorn` via

    gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 wsgi:app
    
This runs the recommendation server with 4 workers, that means at least 4 users can use the 
server at the same time. Make sure to scale this to your needs. Also adjust the IP adress
the server is listening on. `0.0.0.0` exposes it to your network!

## Contrib Models

Multiple different models have already been implemented and are ready for you to use. The
following table provides an overview about them:

| Classname | Description | Trainable |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| JiebaSegmenter | Chinese segmentation prediction with [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) | no |
| LevenshteinStringMatcher | "Fuzzy" string matching | yes |
| NltkStemmer | Word stemming prediction with [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), using its PorterStemmer | no |
| SklearnMentionDetector | Mention detection with [sklearn-crfsuite](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sklearn-crfsuite), using a conditional random field, trained with gradient descent using the L-BFGS method | yes |
| SklearnSentenceClassifier | Sentence classification with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), using its multinominal naive bayes classifier and  TF-IDF counts as features | yes |
| SpacyNerClassifier | Named-entity prediction with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) | no |
| SpacyPosClassifier | Part-of-speech prediction with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) | no |
| AdapterSequenceTagger | Sequence tagger using [Adapters](https://adapterhub.ml/) | no |
| AdapterSentenceClassifier | Sentence classifier using [Adapters](https://adapterhub.ml/) | no |
| FlairNERClassifier | Sequence tagger using [Flair](https://flairnlp.github.io/) | no |

For using trainable recommenders it is important to check the checkbox *Trainable* when adding
the external recommender to your project. To be able to get predictions of a added trainable
recommenders you need to start creating annotations in the corresponding layer. 
Afterwards click on the speechbubble-symbol (*Recommendation*) on the left side and choose *Save* 
to train the recommender. Now new predictions will be displayed.

The contrib models are an example and are intended to be used with INCEpTION, therefore they might not be a
100% fit for you, e.g. `create_prediction`. If your project uses a different type system than DKPro, then you can
alter the variables in `inception_util.py`.

### Jieba Segmenter

This recommender uses [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) for predicting Chinese segmentation.

### S-BERT sentence classifier

This recommender uses [S-BERT](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) together with
[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for sentence classification.

## Development

The following section describes how to develop your own recommender. **inception-recommender** 
comes with example requests which can be found in `examples/requests`.

### Tester

The tester allows to send different requests to your external recommender, thereby you
do not need to run INCEpTION during (early) development.

    $ python scripts/tester.py train -h
    usage: tester.py [-h] [-u USER] {train,predict}
    
    Test your INCEpTION external recommender.
    
    positional arguments:
      {train,predict}       The request type you want to use.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u USER, --user USER  The user issuing the request.
      
### Developing in deployment setting

The simplest way to develop in deployment setting, that is using `gunicorn` is to just run

    make gunicorn
    
This starts `gunicorn` with 4 workers and hot-code reloading.
